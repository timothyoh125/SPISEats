    <p>Here are your Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>   
        <li>1 tin coconut milk (cream only)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 cup almonds</li>
        <li>1 cup dates</li>
        <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cashews</li>
        <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 lemon (juice only)</li>
        <li>1 tin coconut milk (cream only)</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2 cups strawberries</li>    
    </ul>
    <p>Here are your Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Leave the tins of coconut milk in the fridge to cool for a few hours. This will separate the water from the cream. Note: It’s important you use good quality coconut milk, otherwise the milk and cream might not separate.</li>
        <li>Line a 7” x 7” baking tin with greaseproof paper.</li>
        <li>Soak the dates in hot water for 10 minutes or until soft. Meanwhile, leave the cashews to soak in hot water in a separate bowl. </li>
        <li>Blend the almonds until fine and add the almond flour to a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Next, drain the dates and blend them with 2 tbsp of the maple syrup to make a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Transfer the paste to the mixing bowl with the almond flour and combine with the cocoa powder and the cream taken from a tin of coconut milk.</li>
        <li>Once well combined, pour the mixture into the baking tin. Use a spatula to level the mixture, then refrigerate the base until the cream mix is ready.</li>
        <li>To make the strawberry cream layer, drain the cashews and place in a blender. </li>
        <li>Add all the remaining cream ingredients to the blender, including 1 cup of the strawberries, and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Remove the base from the refrigerator and pour the strawberry cream layer over the brownie base. Gently tap the baking tin to level the cream layer.</li>
        <li>Cut the remaining strawberries into slices roughly half a cm thick and arrange on top of the cream for decoration.</li>
        <li>Place the baking tin in a freezer for two hours, then serve immediately.</li>        
    </ol>
